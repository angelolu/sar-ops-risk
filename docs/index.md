## Minimize chaos at your ICP
Keep track of the people on teams, the equipment assigned to them, the tasks they are working on, the clues found, and more. This browser-based app syncs in real time, so all search management staff can be kept up to date.

## Features

### Resource management

### Task managment

### Clue tracking

### Radio logging

### Safeguard against outages
Connect a thermal printer to the app to print radio logs, and clue and personnel info as they come in so you have a continuous backup in case of an outage.

Tech can fail, especially in the conditions we work in. It's your responsibility to keep backups and develop contingency plans in case of software, hardware, or infrastructure failure.
